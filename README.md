# Discord Encryption

> We're back baby :)

An experimental encryption solution for Discord using [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases).

Download the `encryption.plugin.js` from the releases [here](https://github.com/itsXactlY/discord-encryption).

## Features

Adds ability to encrypt / decrypt messages on discord using a set password

- Utilizes AES-256 encryption via the [crypto-js library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js)
- Passwords are saved per-chat
- Messages are decrypted the moment they are receved with little to no delay
- Encrypted messages appear as green
- Messages that fail to be decrypted (most likely due to an incorrect password) display a message and appear as red

## Development

This plugin uses [`rollup`](https://rollupjs.org/) to bundle what's in `src` into the final `encryption.plugin.js` script.

Getting `rollup` to work with `BetterDiscord` was a **gamechanger** as it allows the plugin to use multiple src files instead of just one. This makes development much nicer.

How to build Build:

```
$ yarn && yarn build
```

> This runs both `rollup`, and a `build-patch` script to add the required `BetterDiscord` META tags.
